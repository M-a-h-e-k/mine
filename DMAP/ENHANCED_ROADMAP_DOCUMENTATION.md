# Enhanced Roadmap System - Implementation Summary

## Overview
The roadmap system has been enhanced according to your maturity-level driven logic specifications. Here's what has been implemented:

## Key Improvements

### 1. Fixed Maturity Mapping
- **A = Level 1, B = Level 2, C = Level 3, D = Level 4, E = Level 5**
- This mapping is now consistently applied throughout the system

### 2. Sub-dimension Maturity Calculation
- Each sub-dimension's current maturity level is determined by taking the **most representative level** from all its related questions
- Formula: **Average score rounded to nearest whole level**
- Example: If a sub-dimension has scores [2, 3, 2], average = 2.33 → Level 2

### 3. Target Level Logic
- Target level is **normally one level higher** unless current level is already 5
- Current Level 1 → Target Level 2
- Current Level 2 → Target Level 3
- Current Level 3 → Target Level 4
- Current Level 4 → Target Level 5
- Current Level 5 → Target Level 5 (maintenance)

### 4. Level Transition Recommendations
Each sub-dimension shows specific recommendations in the format:
**"L{current}→L{target}: {specific recommendation}"**

Examples:
- Build: "L2→L3: Implement consistent deployment process with automated checks"
- Design: "L1→L2: Introduce basic security design principles and guidelines"
- Application Tests: "L3→L4: Implement comprehensive security test coverage"

### 5. Phase Assignment Based on Current Maturity
Improvement items are assigned to phases based on current maturity level:

- **Phase 0-3 months** → Sub-dimensions at Level 1 or Level 2 (highest priority fixes)
- **Phase 3-6 months** → Sub-dimensions at Level 3 (medium-term improvements)  
- **Phase 6-12 months** → Sub-dimensions at Level 4 (optimizations to reach Level 5)

### 6. Overall Maturity Calculation
- **Overall Maturity Score** = Sum of average scores of all dimensions / Number of dimensions
- **Dimension Average Score** = Sum of scores for all questions in dimension / Number of questions in dimension

## Enhanced Functions Implemented

### Core Calculation Functions
1. `get_maturity_level_from_score(score)` - Maps scores to 1-5 levels using rounding
2. `calculate_overall_maturity_score(product_id, user_id)` - Calculates overall maturity using proper mathematical formulas
3. `calculate_actual_subdimension_scores(product_id, user_id)` - Calculates sub-dimension scores with fixed A=1,B=2,C=3,D=4,E=5 mapping

### Roadmap Generation Functions
1. `generate_subdimension_roadmap(product_id, user_id)` - Creates phase-organized sub-dimension roadmap
2. `generate_overall_roadmap(product_id, user_id)` - Creates 12-month strategic plan based on maturity levels

### Recommendation Functions
1. `get_level_transition_recommendation(subdimension, current_level, target_level, dsomm_data)` - Provides specific L{x}→L{y} recommendations
2. `get_improvement_phase(current_level)` - Assigns improvement phases based on maturity
3. `get_phase_priority(current_level)` - Provides numeric priority for sorting

## Template Enhancements

### Sub-dimension Roadmap Tab
- Organized into 3 columns by phase priority:
  - **0-3 Months (Highest Priority)** - Red border, Level 1-2 items
  - **3-6 Months (Medium Priority)** - Yellow border, Level 3 items  
  - **6-12 Months (Optimization)** - Blue border, Level 4 items
- **Maintenance section** for Level 5 achieved items

### Strategic Roadmap Tab
- Enhanced with maturity strategy explanation
- Shows current overall maturity level
- Priority legend and roadmap summary
- Color-coded phases based on priority

## Benefits

### 1. Fully Computable from Assessment Data
- The roadmap is completely derived from questionnaire responses
- No manual intervention required
- Consistent and repeatable results

### 2. Maturity-Level Driven
- Priorities are based on actual maturity gaps
- Focus on bringing lower-level areas up first
- Logical progression from basic to advanced

### 3. Actionable Recommendations
- Specific level transition guidance
- Clear improvement paths
- Time-bound phases

### 4. Adaptable Framework
- Works with any DSOMM-style assessment dataset
- Easy to extend with new sub-dimensions
- Configurable recommendation library

## Usage

The enhanced roadmap system automatically:

1. **Analyzes** assessment responses using A=1, B=2, C=3, D=4, E=5 mapping
2. **Calculates** current maturity levels for each sub-dimension
3. **Identifies** improvement opportunities by comparing current to target levels
4. **Assigns** recommendations to appropriate phases based on current maturity
5. **Generates** a comprehensive 12-month strategic plan

## Example Workflow

For a product with assessment responses:
1. System calculates sub-dimension scores (e.g., Build: 2.3, Deployment: 1.8, Design: 3.2)
2. Maps to maturity levels (Build: L2, Deployment: L2, Design: L3)
3. Assigns to phases:
   - Phase 1 (0-3 months): Build, Deployment (L2 → L3)
   - Phase 2 (3-6 months): Design (L3 → L4)
4. Provides specific recommendations:
   - Build: "L2→L3: Implement automated build process with dependency management"
   - Deployment: "L2→L3: Implement consistent deployment process with automated checks"
   - Design: "L3→L4: Integrate security architecture reviews and risk assessment"

This creates a prioritized, actionable roadmap that organizations can follow to systematically improve their security maturity.
